\section{Summary}

With the changing structure of OWI and the history of the different groups clouding status of individual positions, this year is an important one for laying out a new direction on sturdy foundations.
The newly created Data Science team has somewhat less of a burden of the background and history as the other groups.
With my transition from what was the Developer (Java) team to the Data Science team, there is much opportunity to lay out a direction that will help both teams and OWI more broadly.
With this document I'd like to lay out what I think I can bring to the Data Science team as well as what I'd like to keep in touch with from my previous work.

As a side note, I think it is worth discussing in this context the transition from work that has been planned under the old organizational structure and that work which is upcoming.
The planning techniques of the two groups are quite different, and the communication between them regarding my time has not gone as smoothly as we would have wanted.
I think this may only escalate going forward, so it is something to articulate at this point.
The expectations of projects I have worked on should be adjusted to reflect this new position, and we will likely have to deal with some obligations that are outstanding that might affect planning.
To date I am not aware of what conversations have occured regarding this, and I have failed to initiate them myself.

\section{Integration with Data Science team}

As a member of the Data Science team going forward, I'd like to better integrate with the team and the projects they currently work on.
Thus far, the team has been patient with me and kept me involved with what is going on even though my work has kept me from being actively involved in much of what the team is doing.
With the holding pattern that we are currently in, it would be nice to define what my role would be going forward and start building a measure of success in terms of integration with this team.

In addition to this, the integration has been stalled by ongoing work on projects outside the Data Science team.
Balancing the priorities of two teams has been a struggle, and having a clear picture of what the overall priorities are would be beneficial.
Overall, clear communication of what the expectations for dealing with resources across teams are will help to clear up this conflict going forward.
As much as possible I'll try to be proactive about managing my time in relation to this, but it seems that some of this will need to happen a level above where I sit.
